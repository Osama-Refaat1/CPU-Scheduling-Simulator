# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator implemented using the Round Robin algorithm. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Windows Forms for easy interaction and visualization of the scheduling process.

## Features

- **Round Robin Scheduling**: Simulates the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm.
- **Interactive GUI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring the simulation parameters and visualizing the scheduling process.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to customize parameters such as time quantum, number of processes, arrival time, and burst time.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the execution of processes and the movement of the CPU scheduler through a Gantt chart.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates and displays performance metrics such as average turnaround time and average waiting time.

## Installation

To run the CPU Scheduling Simulator on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Osama-Refaat1/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator.git
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the code.
4. Run the application to launch the CPU Scheduling Simulator GUI.
5. Alternatively, you can download the executable file from the [Download Executable](https://github.com/Osama-Refaat1/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator/raw/main/bin/debug/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator.exe)
 directory.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Use the GUI controls to configure the simulation parameters.
3. Click the "Run Simulation" button to start the simulation.
4. Observe the Gantt chart to visualize the scheduling process and monitor the execution of processes.
5. View the performance metrics displayed on the GUI.
